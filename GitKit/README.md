## About

[Contents]

GitKit is the FarNet module for git operations in Far Manager.
GitKit uses [LibGit2Sharp] and git is not needed as such.
Git may be optionally used for getting credentials.

## Credentials

[Contents]
[Settings](#settings)

Remote git hosts may require credentials, user name and password.
GitKit offers two ways, with some advantages and disadvantages.

With `UseGitCredentials` set to false, an input dialog is used. Enter user name
and password and optionally save them for later use. The environment variable
`GitKit_User` is used for keeping credentials.

Alternatively, if you have git installed and available in the path, set
`UseGitCredentials` to true in order to use git for getting credentials.
