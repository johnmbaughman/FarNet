## Settings

Module settings: `[F11] \ FarNet \ Settings \ RightControl`

- `RegexLeft`

    This regular expression defines caret stops on moving left.

- `RegexRight`

    This regular expression defines caret stops on moving right.

**Regex examples**

Default patterns. Stops are similar to Visual Studio:

    (?x: ^ | $ | (?<=\b|\s)\S )
    (?x: ^ | $ | (?<=\b|\s)\S )

Patterns with stops similar to Word/WordPad (`_` stops, too):

    (?x: ^ | $ | (?<=\b|\s)\S | (?<=[^_])_ | (?<=_)[^_\s] )
    (?x: ^ | $ | (?<=\b|\s)\S | (?<=[^_])_ | (?<=_)[^_\s] )

Default patterns with two more breaks: letter case and digits:

    (?x: ^ | $ | (?<=\b|\s)\S | (?<=\p{Ll})\p{Lu} | (?<=\D)\d | (?<=\d)[^\d\s] )
    (?x: ^ | $ | (?<=\b|\s)\S | (?<=\p{Ll})\p{Lu} | (?<=\D)\d | (?<=\d)[^\d\s] )


The same with comments, thanks to `(?x:)` together with ignored white spaces:

    (?x:
        ^ | $ # start or end of line
        |
        (?<=\b|\s)\S # not a space with a word bound or a space before
        |
        (?<=\p{Ll})\p{Lu} # an upper case letter with a lower case letter before
        |
        (?<=\D)\d | (?<=\d)[^\d\s] # a digit/not-digit with a not-digit/digit before
    )
