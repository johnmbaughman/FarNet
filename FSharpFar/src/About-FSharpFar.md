### ModuleSettings

Do not use records, they are odd and in fact require more ceremony.

```fsharp
[<CLIMutable>]
type Data = {
    Name: string
    Age: int
}

type MySettings(fileName: string) =
    inherit ModuleSettings<Data>(fileName)
    override _.NewData() = { Name = "qwerty"; Age = 0 }
```

(1) `[<CLIMutable>]` noise.

(2) Records have no defaults. OK, this is solved by added `NewData`.
Also noise and values are set not where defined.

(3) Immutability. Needs some not yet added `SetData`.
Note that `mutable` is no go, not CLI-compliant.

The class type works better, even with its own noise:

```fsharp
type Data() =
    member val Name = "q1" with get, set
    member val Age = 0 with get, set

type MySettings(fileName: string) =
    inherit ModuleSettings<Data>(fileName)
```

### 1.16.3 Always use --target:library

We can build apps but they cannot run without FSharp.Core.dll and others.
Unless apps are in FARHOME, which is odd.

So let's build just libraries and simplify configuration as a result:
options -a or --target are not needed (ignored).

Change:

- nothing on reading config
- nothing on `Project`, the default target of .fsproj is library
- on `compile:`, add `--target:library` after other options, it takes over

***
### DLL hell System.Text.Json

v1.16.2 - use lib\net4* assemblies if available.

System.Memory (FSharpFar) was netstandard2.0.
~ System.Numerics.Vectors is take from GAC (C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\System.Numerics.Vectors.dll).
And

    Could not load type 'System.Numerics.Vector`1' from assembly 'System.Numerics.Vectors, Version=4.0.0.0...

Using lib\net* fixed the problem in scripts run by FSharpFar.

But it is not enough for fsx, System.Numerics.Vectors is still taken from GAC.
Solved by adding System.Numerics.Vectors to FSharpFar.

NB
Ideas of what's wrong came from using `#r "nuget: System.Text.Json,6.0.0"` in a separate script that worked.
See generated `C:\TEMP\TEMP\NuGet\*\Project.fsproj.fsx` lines like `-r:...`

NB
And the proper understanding of wrong loads came from `GetAssemblies.fsx`.

NB
Still mystery: fsx interactive with `#load "...\1-JsonNode.fsx"` shows
assemblies loaded from GAC (unlike with FSharpFar).

***
### v1.16.2 System.Runtime.CompilerServices.Unsafe and System.Buffers

If remove from .config ~ all runs but on editing scripts in Far a red mark is shown at (1,1).
Hove mouse ~ "cannot find System.Runtime.CompilerServices.Unsafe".
So keep it at least for smooth editing.

As for System.Buffers, it all starts to fail without it.
Sure keep it.

### F# v6, dotnet 6, etc.

#### Outdated package test

    dotnet paket outdated -s

gets

```
Outdated packages found:
  Group: Main

#### Retire workaround for nuget in scripts

**Enable #r "nuget: ..."**

The new F# 5 feature `#r "nuget: ..."` does not work right out of the box.
You need Visual Studio installed and the environment variable `VSAPPIDDIR` set (use your actual path):

    VSAPPIDDIR=C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Community\Common7\IDE\

***
### Trace block `trace{}` vs `Trace.Line`

`Trace.Line`

It is slightly more verbose, both in code and output.

Tuples are passed as `((x, y))`.
Otherwise `y`  in `(x, y)` is treated as the optional parameter.
This may or may not compile, the latter is even worse.
This caveat is easy to forget.

`trace{}`

Looks good in code and output.

Effective, yields are inlined.

Be careful on refactoring.
Deeper nested namespaces or modules may break inlining.
ILSpy the generated code.

***
### FSharp.Compiler.Service hacking

The main repo - https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp

clone,

    cd .\fcs
    build.cmd
    cd ..
    cd .\artifacts\bin\fcs\Release\net461

get:

    FscExe.exe
    FsiExe.exe

***
### FCS Packages

see .\packages\FSharp.Compiler.Service\FSharp.Compiler.Service.nuspec

    <dependency id="System.Collections.Immutable" version="1.5.0" exclude="Build,Analyzers" />
    <dependency id="System.Reflection.Metadata" version="1.6.0" exclude="Build,Analyzers" />
    <dependency id="System.ValueTuple" version="4.4.0" exclude="Build,Analyzers" />

DO:

    "System.Collections.Immutable" Version="1.5.0"
    "System.Reflection.Metadata" Version="1.6.0"

-- need to pin, to keep in sync, latest versions make issues -- more dependencies??

    "System.ValueTuple" version="4.4.0"

-- we use System.ValueTuple (4.5) fine, keep using, mind Far.exe.config

***
### FSharp.Core assembly and package versions

Versions are different, 2019-02-02:

- Assembly version is 4.6.0. This version must be in `Far.exe.config`.
- Package version is 4.6.1 and it may change further.

***
### FSharpFar.fs.ini and module FSharpFar.X

UPDATE: We retired `Convert-Project.ps1`, so the problem is no more.

If we use `Convert-Project.ps1` to make `FSharpFar.fs.ini` then
some files works fine, some fail with

    System.Exception: not an assembly reference

Namely, files before

    load=.\FarModule.fs

work. `FarModule.fs` and all after it fails.

This line is the culprit:

    module FSharpFar.FarModule

If I change names then all is fine.
But it is legal and VS compiles.

It looks like an FCS bug.

***
### Editor flow notes

Why `post ... Open`. In modal windows `Open` blocks and the job code after
`Open` is not called till the exit (and that is why `Open` must be the last
code in its function). But `post` is not blocking, so the flow continues
even if `Open` blocks.

Why `.Closed.Add`. I do not have cases but it is possible that something closes
the editor before our next step. In this case we should skip waiting for exit,
all is done. So add the handler as store `closed`.

Why `try ... Open`. `Open` may throw. We cannot properly deal with an
error in the posted code, so we keep the error for the next flow code.

Next step. If `Open` failed then raise the stored error. If the editor is
already closed the do nothing. Else create and return the waiter. We cannot
wait in Far code.

Next step. The waiter waits.

***
### fsi object

**Exposed, June 2020**

We provide `fsi` via the auto opened module and its

    let fsi = FSharp.Compiler.Interactive.Shell.Settings.fsi

This requires the extra reference to FCS.dll (alas) but it's worth it:

- `fsi.exe` has it, so users expect it
- useful for `fsx.exe`
- useful for session settings
- useful as existing object to test something
- this extra reference might be useful for hacking

Interestingly, `fsi.CommandLineArgs` is settable.

**Before...**

**The bad.**

"FSharp.Compiler.Service/interactive" tells how to enable `fsi` in a session.
It does not tell that *FSharp.Compiler.Interactive.Settings.dll* from *Microsoft SDKs* should be packaged for this.
If this DLL is not discovered, an app fails with not clear info.

- [692](https://github.com/fsharp/FSharp.Compiler.Service/issues/692)
- [127](https://github.com/fsharp/FSharp.Compiler.Service/issues/127)

In theory, we can make `fsi` available for scripts as

```FSharp
/// FSharpFar utilities available right away.
[<AutoOpen>]
module FSharpFarUtility
/// Interactive settings.
let fsi = FSharp.Compiler.Interactive.Shell.Settings.fsi
```

but this requires the reference to *FSharp.Compiler.Service*.
We do not want this for all scripts.

**The good.**

This fine tuning is not often needed.
When it is needed, a documented workaround exists, see *samples\fsi*.

NB This object seems to be global, if we change data in one session then all sessions are affected.

***
### System.Collections.Immutable and System.Reflection.Metadata

They are used in `FSharp.Compiler.Service\src\absil`

- `ilsign.fs`
- `ilwritepdb.fs`
- `ilwritepdb.fsi`

We do not package them.
Is there a use case when this is a problem?

### 2020-07-14 Remove FSharp.Core.optdata, FSharp.Core.sigdata

Do I need to include FSharp.Core.optdata and FSharp.Core.sigdata?

-- No, unless you are doing something with very old FSharp.Core.dll.

From "FSharp.Compiler.Service/corelib"

### 2020-05-24 Tempting Script.RelativePath()

Kind of works.

But it's not discoverable.

And it's lame that we can specify the second parameter `root`, why?
Moreover, it only takes the drive part from `root`, why?

```fsharp
open System.IO
open System.Runtime.CompilerServices

/// Script tools.
type Script =
    /// Gets the full path combined from the script root and the specified path.
    /// - path: Relative or absolute path.
    static member RelativePath (path, [<CallerFilePath>](?root: string)) =
        Path.GetFullPath(Path.Combine(Path.GetDirectoryName(root.Value), path))
```

### 2016-10-21 v1.0, self-contained package

**F# core is included. Why Far home?**

*FSharp.Core.dll* can probably live in some standard assembly search locations, not necessarily Far home.
But FCS also needs *FSharp.Core.optdata* and *FSharp.Core.sigdata* and its search is not the same.
Far home works in both cases, so let it be the location of our packaged F# core files.

**MSBuild is no longer needed with FCS 8.0**

See [#631](https://github.com/fsharp/FSharp.Compiler.Service/issues/631).
In 8.0 MSBuild is still loaded (not used) if it is present.

### 2016-09-04 `exec:` and console output

Intercept `Console.Out` / `Error` and use `ShowUserScreen` / `SaveUserScreen` automatically.

So `exec:` is fine for any script, except operating on console buffer.

**IDEA**
Intercept `Out` and `Error` separately. Different colors?

### 2016-08-26 How `#r` works

[from](https://sergeytihon.com/2014/07/23/avoid-using-relative-paths-in-r-directives/)

> `#r` means to reference by dll-path; focusing on name. This means that FSI will
use the file name first, looking in the system-wide search path and only then
try to use the string after #r as a directory-relative hint

> So that means, `#r` is not reliable way to reference assemblies. You can get
into the situation when your script depends on the environment: assemblies in
GAC, installed software (like version of ASP.NET) and so on. To avoid this it
is better to explicitly specify an assembly search path (`#I`) and then
reference the assembly:

````
    #I "../packages/nuget.core.2.8.2/lib/net40-Client"
    #r "Nuget.Core.dll"
    #r "System.Xml.Linq.dll"
````

### 2016-08-25 FSharp.Compiler.Service requires MSBuild 12

FSharp.Compiler.Service depends on MSBuild 12 (VS 2013).

The team decided to use assembly redirection to MSBuild 14 (VS 2015).

- [#602](https://github.com/fsharp/FSharp.Compiler.Service/issues/602).
- [App.config](https://github.com/fsharp/FSharp.Compiler.Service/blob/61fb67134197c621411359ef1597360023c3775b/src/fsharp/FSharp.Compiler.Service.ProjectCrackerTool/App.config)

So we use `Far.exe.config` with assembly redirection and FSharpFar requires MSBuild 14.

**Q**
Will this work on a machine with MSBuild 12?

**N**
They also redirect FSharp.Core.
We just keep this in mind.
