# Using fsx.exe and FSharpFar

Suppose we have an F# source file [Module1.fs](Module1.fs) (or it could be some
*Lib.dll*) and it does not depend on FarNet. Let's see how it may be called by
fsx and FSharpFar.

Create the configuration [.fs.ini](.fs.ini) and add *Module1.fs* to its `[fsc]`
section (for an assembly it would be some `-r:.\bin\Lib.dll`).

## Sample 1: fsi.CommandLineArgs

**Task:** Run the function `Module1.hello` with an input parameter, e.g. "John".

**Run by fsx**

Create the script [App1.fsx](App1.fsx) which uses `fsi.CommandLineArgs` and call it as:

    fsx App1.fsx John

**Run by FSharpFar**

We do not need a script for this task:

    fs: Module1.hello "John"

or, without interactive output:

    fs: exec: ;; Module1.hello "John"

## Sample 2: conditional compilation

**Task:** Run the function `Module1.hello` with interactive input.

Create the script [App2.fsx](App2.fsx) which defines input UI using conditional compilation:

```fsharp
#if FARNET
// compiled in FSharpFar, use input box
#else
// otherwise use Console.ReadLine()
#endif
```

**Run by fsx**

    fsx App2.fsx

**Run by FSharpFar**

    fs: exec: file=App2.fsx
