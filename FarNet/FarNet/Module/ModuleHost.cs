	/// <para>
	/// The host does not have to unregister dynamically registered actions

	/// <remarks>
	/// The module may override this method to perform preparation procedures.
	/// Normally this is not needed for a simple module with a single action.
	/// It is useful when a complex module provides several actions and
	/// wants common steps to be performed by this method.
	/// <para>
	/// NOTE: This method is called only for module actions:
	/// <c>Invoke()</c> methods and handlers registered by <c>Register*()</c> methods.
	/// It is not called on events added by a module to editors, viewers, dialogs or panels.
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// Example: PowerShellFar starts loading of the PowerShell engine in a background thread on connection.
	/// This method waits for the engine loading to complete, if needed. Registered PowerShellFar actions
	/// simply assume that the engine is already loaded. But editor event handlers still have to care.

	/// <para>
	/// It is allowed to return false but this option should be used sparingly,
	/// there must be really good reasons to disturb normal exiting process.
	/// The most important reason is that a user really wants that.
