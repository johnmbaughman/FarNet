/// This kind of a menu is more suitable for a list of objects than a set of commands.
/// It provides incremental filtering with various options.
/// <para>
/// Keys:<br/>
/// [CtrlC], [CtrlIns] - copy text of the current item to the clipboard.<br/>
/// [CtrlDown] - this is a default key to open a permanent filter input box.<br/>
/// [Backspace] - remove the last symbol from the incremental filter string (until the initial part is reached, if any).<br/>
/// [ShiftBackspace] - remove the incremental filter string completely, even initial part (rarely needed, but there are some cases).<br/>
