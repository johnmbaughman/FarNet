## Description {#Description}

[Contents](#Contents)

Features

 * Smart file and folder history lists
 * Ready for typing incremental filter
 * Reduced noise (e.g. excluded temporary files)
 * For other features see history lists help (F1)

The history log is updated automatically on editing and viewing files.
The folders log is updated on openings from the smart history list.

The smart history list shows items in heuristically improved order. Recently
used items are sorted by last times, as usual. Items not used for a while are
sorted by ranks. Rank is based on last time, frequency, activity, and factors
calculated by training.

How training works. For every item record it builds several ranked lists with
different factors. The list with the item nearest to the top wins. Finally the
factors that maximize the total difference between the plain and ranked lists
for all records are taken.

Background history training and update starts periodically after selecting
items from smart lists. Thus, manual trainings and updates and not necessary.

History log files:

- *%FARLOCALPROFILE%\FarNet\Vessel\VesselHistory.txt*
- *%FARLOCALPROFILE%\FarNet\Vessel\VesselFolders.txt*

## Settings {#Settings}

[Contents](#Contents)

The settings panel is opened from the menu in panels:
`[F11] \ FarNet \ Settings \ Vessel`

*MaximumDayCount*

 : Maximum number of recorded days to keep the records for. The default is 42.

*MaximumFileCount*

 : Maximum number of tracked items, files or folders. The default is 1000.

*Limit0*

 : The first group span in hours. It defines the most recently used items.
   Items are sorted by last used times, like in the usual history. This
   value also defines the period for automatic background training.
   The default and recommended value is 2 hours.

*Limit1*

 : The second group span in hours for *files*. Training finds the best value
   between *Limit0* and *Limit1*. This group items are not recent and not too
   old. They are sorted by ranks, separately from the last group of old items.
   The default is 96 hours. Too large is not useful and makes training slow.

*Limit2*

 : The second group span in hours for *folders*. Training finds the best value
   between *Limit0* and *Limit2*. This group items are not recent and not too
   old. They are sorted by ranks, separately from the last group of old items.
   The default is 96 hours. Too large is not useful and makes training slow.
